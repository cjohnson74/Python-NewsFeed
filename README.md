# Tech-News-Python-Refactor
I use Python to refactor an existing application that was originally built using Node.js. The app, called Just Tech News, is a website where users can post, upvote, and comment on links to news articles. Instead of using Node.js as the back-end language and Handlebars.js as the templating engine, I used Python to create the app and the Python Flask framework to create the application’s views.

## I Learned How to Do The Following:

- Build and deploy to the cloud a Flask API with correct project structure and necessary dependencies.
- 
- Connect the application to an RDBMS database using SQL Alchemy to support the API model.
- 
- Create a REST API that performs CRUD operations.
- 
- Set up and configure a local virtual environment for Python Flask.
- 
- Explain the differences between JavaScript and Python.
- 
- Add templating to the application to allow for user interactions.
- 
- Perform basic DevOps and deploy to a cloud infrastructure.

## So why did I use Python when the same app can be built with Node?

Python is one of the most widely used high-level programming languages, with the [TIOBE](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/) index naming it the second most popular language out of 100 in 2020. It's an interpreted, high-level, open-source, general-purpose programming language that supports procedural, object-oriented, and some functional programming constructs. Created by Guido van Rossum between 1985 and 1990, Python is currently used in such fields as web development, data science, and DevOps.

Python has seen an increase in popularity with the rise of big data—in which extremely large datasets are analyzed computationally to reveal patterns, trends, and associations, especially relating to human behavior and interactions. Python can help us mine big data much faster than any other programming language because it can handle any data type.

Python can also be easily integrated into web applications that need to implement machine learning. Machine learning is a quickly growing branch of artificial intelligence that's based on the idea that systems can learn from data, identify patterns, and make decisions with minimal human intervention.  

Just like most other popular programming languages, Python has several frameworks that can make it easier to use. The two most popular Python frameworks are [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/) and [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/). You’ll use Flask in this course, but you can adapt the same concepts to a Django application.

To complete the refactoring, I connected the Just Tech News application to a relational database using SQLAlchemy, provide user authentication using Flask’s built-in session functionality, and deploy my app to the cloud using Heroku.
