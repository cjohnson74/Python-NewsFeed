# Tech-News-Python-Refactor
In this course, you’ll use Python to refactor an existing application that was originally built using Node.js. The app, called Just Tech News, is a website where users can post, upvote, and comment on links to news articles. Instead of using Node.js as the back-end language and Handlebars.js as the templating engine, you’ll use Python to create the app and the Python Flask framework to create the application’s views.  Python is one of the most widely used high-level programming languages, with the TIOBE index naming it the second most popular language out of 100 in 2020. It's an interpreted, high-level, open-source, general-purpose programming language that supports procedural, object-oriented, and some functional programming constructs. Created by Guido van Rossum between 1985 and 1990, Python is currently used in such fields as web development, data science, and DevOps.  Python has seen an increase in popularity with the rise of big data—in which extremely large datasets are analyzed computationally to reveal patterns, trends, and associations, especially relating to human behavior and interactions. Python can help us mine big data much faster than any other programming language because it can handle any data type.  Python can also be easily integrated into web applications that need to implement machine learning. Machine learning is a quickly growing branch of artificial intelligence that's based on the idea that systems can learn from data, identify patterns, and make decisions with minimal human intervention.  Just like most other popular programming languages, Python has several frameworks that can make it easier to use. The two most popular Python frameworks are Flask and Django. You’ll use Flask in this course, but you can adapt the same concepts to a Django application.  To complete the refactoring, you’ll connect the Just Tech News application to a relational database using SQLAlchemy, provide user authentication using Flask’s built-in session functionality, and deploy your app to the cloud using Heroku.
